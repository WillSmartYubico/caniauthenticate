  "1": FIDO2 Support provided by Windows' webauthn.dll.
description: First introduced with FIDO2, _passwordless_ authentication relies on getting the username either by prompting the user or using persistent cookies, and then prompting the user to use their FIDO device with _user verification_.  User verification may be achieved by providing a PIN via the operating system or browser, or with _built in user verification_ on some authenticators.
