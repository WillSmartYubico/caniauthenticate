title: WebAuthn as a second factor
notes_by_num:
  "1": FIDO2 Support provided by Windows' webauthn.dll.
description: Most similar to the original U2F standard, FIDO as a second factor relies on traditional username and password authentication, with the addition of a FIDO device as an MFA factor. This flow is typically used with web sites that have 'security key' support.
